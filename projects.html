          This is the game I made as my final project at Vancouver Film School. It was the largest
          project I'd ever handled by far. When I look through the code with years of hindsight, I
          think I must have been a lunatic. However it taught me a <i>lot</i> about making a project
          of that scale, and it's helped me start to get a sense for what sorts of things will have
          knock-on effects later on in a project. <br /><br />

        This is something I made as part of a team during a three-day hackathon where the theme was
        "utility". We decided to make an app that could copy/paste across devices. Two teammates
        made an electron client, my other teammate made a WebSocket backend on an Azure server, and
        I made a mobile client using Flutter. <br /><br />
