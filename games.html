          This is the game I made as my final project at Vancouver Film School. It was the largest
          project I'd ever handled by far. When I look through the code with years of hindsight, I
          think I must have been an utter lunatic. However it taught me a <i>lot</i> about making a
          project of that scale, and it's helped me start to get a sense for what sorts of things
          will have knock-on effects later on in a project. <br /><br />
