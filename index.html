                  I do game development. I studied at Vancouver Film School from 2022 to 2023, and I
                  think I learned quite a lot.

                  Through no fault of my own, I've become a mobile developer. I taught myself how to
                  use Flutter for a freelance project, and I've used it since then for hackathons
                  and the like.

              I really need to do like a placeholder thing here. Maybe I'll have a moving slideshow
              with screenshots of my projects.
